	1. What should you create? Using what?

    You need to create a pair of SSH keys. You can create them by typing:
      	      [ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Comment here"]
  [ssh-keygen] is the bash command to start the process of creating a pair of
  keys. [-t rsa] is the option to choose what type of key you want to create
  [-b 4096] is the option to choose how many bits the key will be. [-C "Comm
  ent here"] is the option to comment on the key so that you can remember
  what it is used for.
    After, you will be asked to choose a file location and file name. Then,
  you will be asked to enter a password/passphrase for the private key.
  You are then done creating your public and private keys and can access them
  in the .ssh folder most of the time.

	2. What should you do with the public key?
	   How will it be used? What will it do?

  The public key needs to be set up in the sandbox in the authorized ssh keys
  so that you can connect to the server using your private key.
